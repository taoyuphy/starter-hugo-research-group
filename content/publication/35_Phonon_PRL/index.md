abstract: We propose a method to control surface phonon transport by weak magnetic fields based on the pumping of surface acoustic waves (SAWs) by magnetostriction. We predict that the magnetization dynamics of a nanowire on top of a dielectric films injects SAWs with opposite angular momenta into opposite directions. Two parallel nanowires form a phononic cavity that at magnetic resonances pump a unidirectional SAW current into half of the substrate.





# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary:  surface phonon transport, magnetostriction, unidirectional SAW current.
