abstract: Chiral spin pumping is the generation of a unidirectional spin current in half of ferromagnetic films or conductors by dynamic dipolar stray fields from close-by nanomagnets. We formulate a general theory of long-range chiral interactions between magnets mediated by unidirectional traveling waves, e.g., spin waves in a magnetic film or microwaves in a waveguide. The traveling waves emitted by an excited magnet can be perfectly trapped by a second, initially passive magnet by a dynamical interference effect. When both magnets are excited by a uniform microwave, the chiral interaction between them creates a large imbalance in their magnon numbers.
