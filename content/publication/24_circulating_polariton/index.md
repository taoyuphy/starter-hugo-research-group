abstract: We predict magnon-polariton states circulating unidirectionally in a microwave cavity when loaded by a number of magnets on special lines. Realistic finite-element numerical simulations, including dielectric, time-dependent, and nonlinear effects, confirm the validity of the approximations of a fully analytical input-output model. We find that a phased antenna array can focus all power into a coherent microwave beam with controlled direction and an intensity that scales with the number of magnets.
