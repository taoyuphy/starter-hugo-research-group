Tao Yu is a Professor of Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics, working in School of Physics at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. He leads the group for dynamics of quantum materials, ranging from the unconventional superconductivity, magnetism, correlated spin system to two-dimensional Van der Waals materials. He has wide interest in condensed matter theory, and has particular hobby in developing theory for phenomena with solid experimental ground, which should be full of prediction and explanation power that have been reflected in almost all his publications. 

Life is short but full of adventure, so one has to choose topics for investigation to satisfy the curiosity. Prof. Yu's research interests include 1) Unconventional superconductivity for topological properties, ultrafast engineering and Keldysh nonequilibrium dynamics, and superconducting mechanism in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene; 2) Magnetism for chiral interactions between magnons and various quasiparticles, magnon linear and nonlinear transports, spin-momentum locking of waves, and skymion topological dynamics; 3) Spintronics for many-body spin dynamics in semiconductor, graphene, and cold atoms, various spin phenomena such as spin Hall, spin pumping and Seebeck eects; 4) Semiconductor optics for valley dynamics in monolayer/bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides, many-body excitonic states, and optical engineering of quantum states. 


There are multiple master and PhD graduate students (2),  visiting students (2), postdoctoral researchers (2), and research associate position openings in this group. Please contact Prof. Dr. Yu via taoyuphy@mail.ustc.edu.cn if you are interested in joining the group.
