Tao Yu (于涛) works in the School of Physics at **Huazhong University of Science and Technology** (Wuhan, China) as a Professor (full) of Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics and Doctoral Supervisor. He is also the guest researcher of **Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter**, and guest editor of **Frontiers in Physics**. His group is supported by National Science Fund for Excellent Young Scholars (abroad) as well as 100 Excellent Young Scholars of Hubei Province. He leads the group for the dynamics of quantum materials, focusing on interesting theoretical problems among the magnetism, spintronics, unconventional superconductivity, correlated spin system, and many-body states in two-dimensional van der Waals materials. He has wide interest in condensed matter theory, and has particular hobby in developing theory for amazing phenomena with solid experimental ground, which should be full of prediction and explanation powers that have been reflected in almost all his publications. 

Life is short but full of fascinating adventure, so one has to choose suitable and real important topics for his/her investigation to satisfy the curiosity. Tao`s research interests mainly include 1) **Unconventional superconductivity** for the topological properties, ultrafast optical engineering by the Keldysh formalism, and superconducting mechanism in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene; 2) **Magnetism** for chiral interactions between various quasiparticles, magnon nonlinear transport, spin-momentum locking of waves, and topological dynamics of skymions; 3) **Spintronics** for many-body spin dynamics in semiconductor, graphene, and cold atoms, and various spin phenomena such as spin Hall, spin pumping, and spin Seebeck effects; 4) **Semiconductor optics** for exciton valley dynamics in mono- and bi-layer transition metal dichalcogenides, and optical engineering of quantum states. More information can be found in his Researchgate https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tao-Yu-10.


There are multiple master and PhD graduate students (2), visiting student(2), postdoctoral researchers (3), and research associate position openings in Yu`s group. Please contact Tao via taoyuphy@hust.edu.cn if you have strong interest in condensed matter theory and are interested in joining the group. We provide competitive salary and comfortable work conditions.
