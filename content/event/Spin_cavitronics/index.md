summary: Tao and Gerrit are invited to present their works about Chiral Spin Cavitronics with Magnetic Insulators on META 2021 conference.
abstract: "Spin cavitronics addresses the coupling of phononic, magnonic, or photonic cavity modes with spin excitations
in magnetic structures and devices. In this talk, I will introduced and review recent theoretical and experimental
work on the spin cavitronics of yttrium iron garnet (YIG) with emphasis on the role of chirality."
