summary: Tao will present his works about Chiral Excitations in Spintronics on Online Spintronics Seminar. Recorded video will be available online.
abstract: "We recently witnessed the discovery of various chiral interactions between magnetic, phononic, electronic, and photonic excitations in spintronics that mediate the excitation of quasiparticles into a single direction, leading to phenomena such as chiral spin and phonon pumping, chiral spin Seebeck, magnonic skin, magnon trap, magnon Doppler, and spin diode effects. Intriguing analogies with electric counterparts in the nano-optics and plasmonics exists. In this talk, I will present a unified electrodynamic picture for dynamical chirality in spintronics and compare it with that in nano-optics and plasmonics. Based on the general theory, I subsequently review the theoretical progress and experimental evidence of chiral interaction between various excitations in magnetic, photonic, electronic, and phononic nanostructures at GHz time scales."
