abstract: "We recently witnessed the discovery of various chiral interactions between magnetic, phononic, electronic, and photonic excitations in spintronics that mediate the excitation of quasiparticles into a single direction, leading to phenomena such as chiral spin and phonon pumping, chiral spin Seebeck, magnonic skin, magnon trap, magnon Doppler, and spin diode effects [1-6]. Intriguing analogies with electric counterparts in the nano-optics and plasmonics exists. In this talk, I will present a unified electrodynamic picture for dynamical chirality in spintronics and compare it with that in nano-optics and plasmonics [1]. Based on the general theory, I subsequently review the theoretical progress and experimental evidence of chiral interaction between various excitations in magnetic, photonic, electronic, and phononic nanostructures at GHz time scales.
